      <h3>New Automobile Unveiled</h3>
      <p class="date">February 14, 1924</p>
      <p>
        Miss Darcy, our benefactor and patron of the arts, has recently purchased a new automobile. With the license plate "D41924", it is said to be the talk of the town. The car will be unveiled at the upcoming Gala night, promising an unforgettable evening of music and style. Her reservations here at the Golden Age Society are not few and far between, and we are honored to have her as a guest.

    <h2>An evening of jazz</h2>
    <p>
      
      Step out of the ordinary and into the rhythm of the age! Every Monday, Thursday, and Saturday night, the doors swing open and the band strikes up the hottest jazz in town. Bright horns sing, the piano rolls like thunder, and the drums keep a heartbeat that stirs the soul.
      </p>
<p>
Ladies shimmer, gentlemen shine, and the dance floor never rests. The Charleston kicks, the laughter rises, and the music carries you clear to the break of dawn. Fine refreshments flow, good company gathers, and every tune promises a thrill.
    </p>

    <p>You can even gamble at our blackjack tables. How to play: Aces count as ones, Jacks are eleven, Queens twelve, and Kings thirteen, each note carrying its own little thrill.</p>
